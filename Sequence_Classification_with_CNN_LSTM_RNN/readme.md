7. CNN + LSTM Train Set Accuracy = 93.84%
8. CNN + LSTM Test Set Accuracy = 88.1%
9. CNN + LSTM + Dropout Train Set Accuracy = 93.57%
10. CNN + LSTM + Dropout Test Set Accuracy = 86.49%
11. CNN + LSTM + Dropout_2 Train Set Accuracy = 90.50%
12. CNN + LSTM + Dropout_2 Test Set Accuracy = 85.37%


I have run all the models for 4 epochs , because each epoch take 3-4 minutes to run, Number of Epochs will change the result .
As per current situation : The Algorithm that worked best on test set is :
CNN + LSTM without dropout
