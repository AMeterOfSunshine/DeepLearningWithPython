# DeepLearningWithPython

Inside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:

1) Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem
2) Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition
3) Recurrent Neural Networks to predict Stock Prices
4) Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud
5) Boltzmann Machines to create a Recommender System
6) Stacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the Netflix $1 Million prize
